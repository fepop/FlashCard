# Flash Card
A Flash card program I made using Python and Tkinter, it shows a French word and you are given a few seonds to guess whether you know the english meaning or not. Clicking the "Check" button means you were right and removes it from the list of words to show while clicking the "X" button means you didn't get it and it will stay in the list of words
